CTL Exercise Tool
=================
About
-----
This is a CTL Exercise Tool for training basic (and simple nested) operators and quantifiers of CTL formulas with visual representation of the automaton and solutions.

Use
---
A new Automaton with either 4 or 5 states is randomly generated by pressing the Button with the according number. 
The Automaton is then visualized with black circles as states and their corresponding labels and arrows for transitions.
The "New Formula" Button chooses a new formula from a set of available formulas and displays it next to the "Formula:" label.
If you are not sure what the meaning of the formula is, you can mark the checkbox with the "Explain" label, which will display 
an textual explanation with a formal definition, as well as an image. 
The states in which you think the formula holds can be marked by clicking and will then be colored blue. Clicking again unmarks the state.
